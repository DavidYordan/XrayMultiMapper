# v2ray_config_tool
This is a tool for configuring multiple entry and exit chain proxies for v2ray. Currently, it only supports socks5 entry, and shadowsocks, socks5 exit. Future updates will be made if there is a demand.

Place 'xray/xray.exe' in the work path, download from https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases, unzip, and rename.
